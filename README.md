# Medical_Store
This is a simple Medical Store application built using Python and Tkinter in a single script.
It allows users to select common health problems and suggests appropriate medicines.
Users can enter the quantity of each medicine, and the app calculates the total cost.
It displays the list of all selected medicines along with quantity and price summary.
There is no database or file storageâ€”everything runs in memory during the session.
The GUI is built with Tkinter widgets like buttons, labels, entry fields, and radio buttons.
Medicine options include treatment for fever, cough, headache, flu, and more.
The application is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to run locally.
Clone the repo, open the Python file, and run it to get started instantly.
